    <p>
        Once upon a time, in a quiet village surrounded by green hills, lived two girls â€” Zumrad and Qimmat.
        Zumrad was kind, gentle, and full of warmth. But life had not been easy for her.
         Her mother had passed away when she was just a child, and her father, though once loving,
          had remarried a harsh and selfish woman.
